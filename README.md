Data Mining Assignments - Fall 2024 (CMPE-255)
This repository contains all the deliverables for my Data Mining course (CMPE-255) in Fall 2024. The assignments involve using Python, Colabs, AI pair programming tools (GitHub Copilot), and AutoML platforms like Akkio or JADBio.

Table of Contents
Assignment 1: Python in Colab
Assignment 2: AI Pair Programmer with GitHub Copilot
Assignment 3: AutoML with Akkio/JADBio
Assignment 1: Python in Colab
Description:
In this assignment, I explored Python development using Google Colaboratory. I followed tutorials by Derek Banas and implemented the features of advanced Colab tutorials.

Steps Followed:
Implemented Derek Banas' Python tutorial in Google Colab.
Experimented with advanced Colab features (referenced in class slides).
Files:
colab_derek_banas_tutorial.ipynb: This notebook contains the implementation of Derek Banas' Python tutorial in Colab.
colab_advanced_features.ipynb: This notebook covers the advanced features of Colab as shown in the course slides.
How to Run:
Open the notebooks in Google Colab.
Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to see the results.
Assignment 2: AI Pair Programmer with GitHub Copilot
Description:
This assignment focused on using AI pair programming tools to build a coding project. I used GitHub Copilot within Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to demonstrate its capabilities in a project.

Tools Used:
GitHub Copilot (VS Code)
Visual Studio Code
Project:
For this assignment, I created a Python project using GitHub Copilot, demonstrating its ability to assist in coding both backend and frontend components. The AI pair programming tool helped generate code snippets based on comments and partial code inputs.

Video Demo:
You can find the video demonstration of me using GitHub Copilot here.

How to Run:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name.git
Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
Use GitHub Copilot to follow along with the code generation.
Run the project by executing:
php
Copy code
python <your_script_name>.py
Assignment 3: AutoML with Akkio or JADBio
Description:
In this assignment, I explored zero-code AutoML platforms to demonstrate end-to-end machine learning workflows. I used the Akkio platform to perform an AutoML task without writing code.

Tools Used:
Akkio (AutoML platform)
Dataset: [Specify the dataset used if applicable]
Steps:
Set up a free account on Akkio.
Uploaded the dataset and allowed Akkio to train and evaluate a machine learning model.
Generated predictions and visualized the model's performance metrics.
Video Demo:
You can find the video demonstration of me using Akkio here.

Setup Instructions:
Make sure to have the required tools installed for each assignment:
Google Colab for Assignment 1.
Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot for Assignment 2.
Akkio or JADBio platform for Assignment 3.
For AI pair programming, VS Code extensions like GitHub Copilot are essential, and you may need a subscription or student discount for GitHub Copilot.
Tips and Extensions for VS Code:
In the video for Assignment 2, I also demo some useful VS Code extensions and tips:

GitLens: Super useful for Git management in VS Code.
Prettier: For code formatting.
Python: The official Python extension for running and debugging Python scripts.
