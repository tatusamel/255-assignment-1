## Assignment 1: Python in Colab

### Description:

In this assignment, I explored Python development using Google Colaboratory. I followed tutorials by Derek Banas and implemented the features of advanced Colab tutorials.

### Steps Followed:

1. Implemented Derek Banas' Python tutorial in Google Colab.
2. Experimented with advanced Colab features (referenced in class slides).

### Files:

- `derek_banas_codes.ipynb`: This notebook contains the implementation of Derek Banas' Python tutorial in Colab.
- `colab_advanced_features.ipynb`: This notebook covers the advanced features of Colab as shown in the course slides.

### How to Run:

1. Open the notebooks in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to see the results.

You can find the video demonstration of me running the examples of Derek Banas [here](https://youtu.be/sKPy9AMO1RM).

## Assignment 2: AI Pair Programmer with GitHub Copilot

### Description:

This assignment focused on using AI pair programming tools to build a coding project. I used GitHub Copilot within Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to demonstrate its capabilities in a project.

### Project:

For this assignment, I solved a leetcode problem in C++ using GitHub Copilot, demonstrating its ability to assist in coding both backend and frontend components. The AI pair programming tool helped generate code snippets based on comments and partial code inputs.

### Video Demo:
